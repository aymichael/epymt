                        <span>There are several courses of different levels for you to choose. In general, if you are Secondary 3 or above, if you enjoy mathematics and usually are the better ones in your class, there should be a course suitable for you. If you are of lower forms but already have mathematics skills of higher forms, you may also find a suitable course according to the following levels.</span>

                answer={<span>You need to spend 3 intensive weeks on a course. Besides lessons on 9 whole days, you need the other days to prepare, work on exercises, and review. The learning pace is fast and the course schedule is tight. A lot of after class revision is needed. Students should be highly self-motivated and committed. Also, students are expected to be very curious and fond of exploring mathematics beyond his/her level. Otherwise, many of them will lag behind.</span>}

                    <span>
                        We welcome junior form student to take EPYMT course, but please note that EPYMT introduces students more advanced and sophisticated mathematics than that they learn in school so junior form students should be mature enough to face difficulties and frustration. It is important to consider if junior form students are able to learn mathematics together with higher form students (both in mathematics ability and personality).

                    <span>
                        The following courses are designed for the students who are advancing to Secondary 4 or 5. Yet, they are still challenging.
                        <br />
                        - Geometric Perspectives of Complex Numbers (CUSA1014)
                        <br />
                        - Number Theory and Cryptography (SAYT1114)
                        <br />
                        If you are fond of geometry, probably you should choose “Geometric Perspectives of Complex Numbers”, which is a natural extension to your secondary school coordinate geometry module. Or if you enjoy the funniness among numbers, “Number Theory and Cryptography” would be your suitable choice.
                        <br />
                        If you have learnt Calculus (differentiation and integration), you are welcome to apply “Towards Differential Geometry” which suits Secondary 5 or 6 students. If you are able to complete this course at Form 4, you may have a great advantage to become a high-achiever in your Form 5 syllabus. However, without adequate knowledge of Calculus, we advise you not to apply.<br />
                        Finally, the most mathematically challenging course, “Understanding Non-Euclidean Geometry”, is beyond the reach of the vast majority of F.4 students, and it is only suitable for senior form students who have distinguished mathematical performance or have taken any previous EPYMT course. You may consult your teacher if you are capable to take this course.

                question={<span>I am a Form 4/5 student but I have never learnt complex number before. Will it be a barrier for me to attend any of your courses?</span>}
                answer={<span>No, knowing complex numbers or not will not make a big difference, except for the advanced course &quot;Understanding Non-Euclidean Geometry&quot;. &quot;Towards Differential Geometry&quot; and &quot;Geometric Perspectives of Complex Number&quot; are especially designed for F.5 students. However, if you apply for the course &quot;Towards Differential Geometry&quot;, we do expect you to have reasonable competence with calculus.</span>}

                answer={<span>Our courses are intensive and they demand tremendous efforts to master the course contents. Therefore, it is advisable not to skip any one of the lecture, even to take a leave. Attending several dates of the course is strongly discouraged and your application may not be considered if such a condition is acknowledged.</span>}

                answer={<span>A note on the application form states that “recommendation is NOT required if the applicant had applied for admission to EPYMT before” so you can choose not to hand another recommendation letter to us.

For example, those with outstanding performances in the admission test may be invited to take the most mathematically challenging course─ &quot;Understanding Non-Euclidean Geometry&quot;.</span>} />
            <QuestionBox 
                question={<span>How can I prepare for the admission test?</span>} 
                answer={<span>No any specific drills are recommended.<br />To improve your mathematical ability, we advise you to concentrate on your school works and ask questions beyond what the textbook teaches. Also, try to read ahead of your syllabus. For example, if you are a F.4 student, you should try to take a look or even finish the F.5 mathematics textbook and work out the problems by yourself. You could also read some foreign mathematics textbooks or leisure books for enrichment. Nowadays, you can even surf the web to learn advanced mathematics.</span>} />
