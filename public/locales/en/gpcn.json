        "content": "Students can learn the operations and properties of complex numbers and how to use complex numbers on geometry topics taught in secondary school. Also, students can learn how to interpret basic geometric transformations by applying complex calculations. This course aims at broadening and deepening students’ perspectives towards advanced mathematics through understanding the cross-influences of the complex algebra and geometric concepts. This course naturally leads to further geometric concepts, and so is regarded as a pre-requisite of “Understanding Non-Euclidean Geometry”."
