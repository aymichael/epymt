        "content": "In the first half, we will cover some basic knowledge in Number Theory, including modular arithmetic and Euler's theorem. Then, we will cover two topics in Number Theory: primality test and primitive root, which are indispensable in studying Cryptography. In the second half, we will explore some applications of Number Theory in Cryptography, including some classical systems such as Vigenere cipher and some modern systems such as DES, RSA, digital signature. We will also briefly discuss Shor's algorithm: a quantum-based algorithm and QKD: a quantum-based cryptosystem."
